    "Sometimes, we want to create classes that kind of organize functions together, so for example, when we say like `import math` and then we get access to all the `math` functions like`math.abs()` or `math.sqrt()`...etc. Well, what they sometimes end up doing, in OOP this is pretty common, is when you have a bunch of functions that you normally just define like you define like `add1()` and `add2()`, what you want to do is you want to actually organize them into a class, and the reason you do that is just so it stays a little bit structured, you can move all those classes together to another module and continue to use them, and to do something like this you want to use what's called a **static method**. In the example bellow, we made a class called `Math` and what we're going to do in here is we're going to define some methods or some functions that we'd like to be able to use but that are not specific to an instance, so we don't want them to have to make an instance of this `math` class to be able to use these methods, we want to be able to call them at any point, and it doesn't matter if we have an instance of the `math` class or not, we would like to be able to use them. So what we're going to do is actually create what's called a **static method** (static : not changing), static methods : \"they do something but they don't change anything\", they don't change anything because they can't, they don't have access to anything."
